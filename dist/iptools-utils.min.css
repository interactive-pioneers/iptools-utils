/* HOW THIS WORKS:
 *
 * For each media query, a specific detector div is given the height (2^n-1)px if that media query applies.
 * So, first container is given 1px, second 2px, third 4px, fourth 8px, and so forth.
 * In binary, this is 1, 10, 100, 1000, and so forth, respectively.
 * So each media query has a specific binary digit that is 1 if it applies.
 * This way, the sum of all heights (or easier, the height of the container div) is a digit-by-digit representation
 * of all media queries, with 1 being active and 0 being inactive.
 *
 * Example: A list of 5 media queries of which #1, #4, and #5 are active.
 * Media query #1 is active, so its corresponding detector div is 1px (2^0) high.
 * Media query #4 is active, so its corresponding detector div is 8px (2^3) high.
 * Media query #5 is active, so its corresponding detector div is 16px (2^4) high.
 * The detector divs for media query #2 and #3 remain at 0px height.
 * The height of the container div is 1 + 8 + 16 = 25.
 * In binary: 1 + 1000 + 10000 = 11001
 * 1           1           0           0           1
 * #5 (true)   #4 (true)   #3 (false)  #2 (false)  #1 (true)
 *
 * This way, by reading two values -
 * the media queries string with all the names and the height of the detector container -
 * Up to 25 media queries can be determined active or inactive.
 * Since the media queries string never changes at runtime, reading it can be omitted on subsequent detections.
